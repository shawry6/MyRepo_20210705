# MyRepo
I am David Shaw and I am a Podiatrist graduating in 2001, an Exercise Physiologist graduating in 1998 and a failed (broken) Carpenter. 
Career wise I have wonderful family and a successful Podiatry company. 
I chose Fintech as a career path because I want to give back to my profession and most of all my patients by improving the handling and integrity of their sensitive medical data. I see blockchain ledgers as a potential avenue to do this. I am also part-time trader for the past 25+ years and a much more recent crypto investor and enthusiast and wish to become more hands on with my own wealth planning.
