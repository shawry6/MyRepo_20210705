# MyRepo
I am David Shaw and I am a practicing Podiatrist and graduated in 2001, a qualified Exercise Physiologist graduating in 1998 and a failed (broken) Carpenter never completing my apprenticeship due to a rugby injury. I am a father of 2 young boys and husband to a legendary wife.
Career wise I have a successful Podiatry company which I now have partners in and it can run itself. Although I have proven to be successful in business and managing people, I do love just being a clinical podiatrist and connecting with my patients to help them manage their health better. 
My reason for chosing Fintech as a career path is two-fold. Firstly, I want to give back to my profession and most of all my patients by improving the handling and integrity of their sensitive medical data. I see blockchain ledgers as a potential avenue to do this. Secondly, I have been an unqualified, part-time, personal trader for the past 25+ years and a much more recent crypto investor and enthusiast and wish to become more hands on with my own wealth planning towards retirement.
